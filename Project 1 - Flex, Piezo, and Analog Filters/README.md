Lab 1: Introduction to Resistive Sensors and Analog Filtering

Aleida Diaz-Roque

Introduction

This lab serves as an introduction to resistive sensors, specifically the flex sensor and the piezoelectric sensor. The flex sensor measures resistance changes based on bending, while the piezoelectric sensor generates voltages upon deflection or vibration. The goal is to create a musical instrument using both sensors and experimentally validate simple analog filtering techniques.
